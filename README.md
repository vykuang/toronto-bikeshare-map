# Toronto Bikeshare Map

Using monthly refreshed data from [Open Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/), this repository creates a map visualizing bikeshare ridership in Toronto. 

The map will have sliders for time of day and seasonality, in addition to membership type. Frequency of trips is indicated by line intensity
